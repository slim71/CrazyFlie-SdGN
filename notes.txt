- periodic recalibration needed to ensure good precision
- fixed reference system:
	"Vicon system"
	room centre
- asymmetric markers on Drone to ensure distinction from environment
- sw objects linked to physical objects:
	name/alias
	body reference system -> initialized at desired position/orientation
- purpose:
	track following of Wand position
- Wand position -> target
- Kalman filter used
- orientations with quaternions:
	used in the project for ref. systems conversions
	not fed to KF


Basics
- Tracker gets Drone and Wand position/orientation through cameras and markers
- program on PC gets pos/or through Vicon-SSDK library
- program on PC computes needed conversions
- program on PC, through Crazyradio and Python libs for CRPT protocol:
	feeds to the Drone a new target pos (from Wand pos)
	feeds to the Drone KF input (own position)
	

Crazy Real Time Protocol (CRTP)
- developed by Bitcraze
- ACK
- TX (Crazyradio on PC) and RX (Drone)

- packet size: only data payload is considered
