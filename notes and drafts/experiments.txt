position estimator already reset at take-off

supervised_box: position/orientation at each angle of a square, from Vicon
internal_estimate: Vicon and estimate of position/orientation
total_data: all data from Vicon and from estimator
send_attempt: giving the drone some fixed reference points
hover_simple: hover in place for >30s, to test estimate

try to connect and use the client!
use this to observe variables and other stuff

try to check channel usage? lower log rates

collision avoidance brainstorming:
- drone hovering
- object in space
- simplest solution: collision/warning sphere
- two collision triangles? hor/vert
- maybe use Rdot and Thetadot?
- Rdot < 0 --> collision
- Thetadot = 0 --> collision
- xz plane for collision:
    theta > 0 && thetadot < 0
    theta < 0 && thetadot > 0
- xy plane for collision:
    theta from x axis
- dangerous if thetadot = 0
- dangerous if thetadot = 0


    Test2
references in global frame (drone's initial frame), to Vicon's only for KF
	- same origins and frames: works as expected
	- same origins, 90° between frames: drone drifts while taking off, then comes back and works ok
	- same origins, 180°: same

---TODO:
- check Crazyflie client
- produce data for MATLAB
