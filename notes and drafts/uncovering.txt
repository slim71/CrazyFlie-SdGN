send_setpoint: more than once, there are watchdogs to stop the drone (two: 0.5-1s)
send_extpos: drone reference system
drone movements: wrt its initial reference system

send_position_setpoint: m, °
Vicon: mm, °

pitch angle is inverse wrt the "standard" convention

quaternions:
	- vicon/drone: qx,qy,qz,qw
	- others: qw,qx,qy,qz

pitch values entering and exiting the estimator are opposite in sign; why?
- data coherent with conventions
- roll and yaw acceptable
- recheck if inverting pitch sign is ok (shouldn't)

NaN values at the start for the position: because there's not flowdeck?


without the flowdeck the internal estimator does not converge,
even when manually selecting kalaman

EKF already reset at takeoff

PositionHLCommander seems to be the best go-to:
- automatically moves drone to given setpoint
- auto-determination of sleep times
- drone estimation converges to Vicon ref system
Must use a different thread to send Vicon data to aid drone KF
