position estimator already reset at take-off

supervised_box: position/orientation at each angle of a square, from Vicon
internal_estimate: Vicon and estimate of position/orientation
total_data: all data from Vicon and from estimator
send_attempt: giving the drone some fixed reference points
hover_simple: hover in place for >30s, to test estimate
estimate_help: KF var and send_extpos
kalman_variance: position estimate with KF variance adjustment
active_avoidance: try to avoid object collision (passive object incoming)

try to connect and use the client!
use this to observe variables and other stuff

try to check channel usage? lower log rates

collision avoidance brainstorming:
- drone hovering
- object in space
- simplest solution: collision/warning sphere
- two collision triangles? hor/vert
- maybe use Rdot and Thetadot?
- Rdot < 0 --> collision
- Thetadot = 0 --> collision
- xz plane for collision:
    theta > 0 && thetadot < 0
    theta < 0 && thetadot > 0
- xy plane for collision:
    theta from x axis
- dangerous if thetadot = 0
